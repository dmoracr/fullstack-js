# JavaScript FullStack simple project

It includes a Simple NodeJS server and a JavaScript client with some TO DO to resolve

## How to get server up and running

You'll need at least NodeJS `v14.18.2` to execute the server

> The server does not have any dependencies but if you want you can install `nodemon` globally to executes it
> ```bash
> npm install --global nodemon
> ```
>
> In the following steps replace `node` with `nodemon`

to start the server using https you can use:

```bash
node server/server-https.js
```

if the https version does not work you can use:

```bash
node server/server-http.js
```

## How to get client up and running
